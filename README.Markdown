# WordPress Theme - The Code Train

Initially based on Helemaal Niet's "Whitewash" theme, this is a theme which I'm going to be tweaking to make me happy with for The Code Train. I'm also going to be using it as a realworld place to test my Frontend Test Suite.

The reason for tweaking is that whilst I'm mostly happy with the Whitewash theme visually, it's still not perfect for me.  Likewise, looking at the underlying code, there's a lot of badness there.  I want to make things nice.
